As the light of dreams starts to shine again upon this future here,
A resonating wish is cast out for our sake.
In this dazzling light that just always seems to make the darkness disappear,
I will run ahead to overcome my fate.

Giving hope to my own future self,
I bind feelings deep inside of my heart-
Knowing always the things I treasure will be close
And stay beside me each day.

Do you know how to find power inside?
Do you know how to break limits ahead?
Just find your path. Never give up.
Always trust in your power instead.

Facing my reflection within the glass of mirrors in my way,
I shatter who I was and run towards my goal.
Even as the faces that I can see grow stronger with each passing day,
I can feel this passion burn inside my soul.

This TRUTH IN MY HEART keeps me walking on towards my destiny,
Because my will gives me the strength to never fall.
I will not deny or avert my eyes from truths that lie in front of me.
I'LL REACH THE NEXT STAGE TO REALIZE ALL!

As I walked, I sensed you coming near,
But since when had you been so close to me?
This is simply the way our roads now intersect-
A bond we've all learned to see.

But as I look to the sky up above,
Searching through all of the things that I see,
I just can’t shake this strange unease
From the pain of that past memory.

I can feel this strength flowing endlessly inside my yearning heart,
Because I've found the things I swore that I’d protect
As these vistas pass back and forth right here, my troubles seem to disappear
As my feelings and my will both intersect.

BELIEVE IN JUDGELIGHT that now pierces fate and lays within my hands.
I choose to shape this fragile dawn for all to see.
As I smash through all of life’s obstacles with nothing but my inner will,
I BELIEVE MYSELF AND PRECIOUS EMOTION.
I will make my will live on eternally!

At the start of time, when we first began, we swore this solemn vow:
That we would pass our judgment on the darkness here.
Even if we fell to our weaker selves, we swore we'd never turn around.
We would fight until our heartache disappeared.

As this well known scene plays before our eyes and our past fades away,
I feel the signals showing me which way to go.
I will cast aside all the things I hold that weigh me down and block my way,
And I'll choose to venture forth with all I know.

This TRUTH IN MY HEART keeps on guiding me along this winding road.
By following my heart, my strength will never fall.
As I trace it back to its distant source, the place where it once overflowed,
I'LL REACH THE NEXT STAGE TO REALIZE ALL
As I trust the bond that lives inside us all!
