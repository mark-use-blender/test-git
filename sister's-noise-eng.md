Closer to me than any sound that I've heard, your voice rang out, but I could not hear a word.
(SISTER'S NOISE...I FIND IT OUT...)
Though it's been forever since we've been together, you and I have at last been reunited once again.
SISTER'S NOISE is something I long to find, so I will search the deepest depths of my mind,
(SORROW OF YOUR HEART...I SHOOT IT DOWN...)
cause the feelings that we share inside our hearts have brought us here and no one can defy their strength!

I know this is where you should be, but this town's hidden you from me.
Reaching my destination seems to have brought to life my lost memories.
The reality that we knew plays as a distant feedback loop.
All the pain that you hold inside of you goes unrecognized.

Even if all the dreams that I've kept in my heart rise up against me and tear me apart,
I won't give in to despair cause I know that I will make it through if I hold on to my hope!

"Be true to who you are now and every day." This is the message that I long to convey.
(SISTER'S NOISE...I FIND IT OUT...)
Though the pain of misery is reborn endlessly, I know that if I can just remember what it means,
SISTER'S VOICE will come to me in this hour and I will turn even my tears into power!
(SORROW OF YOUR HEART...I SHOOT IT DOWN...)
Cause the strength that we share pierces everything. Our suffering will end when we work as a team!

Afternoons and their twilight glow, this townscape that I've always known, and the sky that my eyes behold. I recall them and the kindness you've shown.
That same kindness within your gaze taught me what I believe today.
When I learn to accept my weakness, I will be strong and bold.

In my times of confusion, the warmth of your hands guided my heart and now I understand.
My one desire is to keep you safe because I know our hope will blow the darkness away!

These strong emotions rising up within me illuminate the world and all that we see,
(SISTER'S NOISE...I FIND IT OUT...)
And the dream that I'm pursuing has continued moving now, so I'll keep on chasing your dream every day.

SISTER'S NOISE is calling out to me now and, with a thunderous voice, its truth echoes out.
(SORROW OF YOUR HEART...I SHOOT IT DOWN...)
Now, I know that the bond that we share cannot compare to any other and will never break!

"Be true to who you are now and every day." This is the message that I long to convey.
(SISTER'S NOISE...I FIND IT OUT...)
Though the pain of misery is reborn endlessly, I know that if I can just remember what it means,

Closer to me than any sound that I've heard, your voice rang out, but I could not hear a word.
(SISTER'S NOISE...I FIND IT OUT...)
Though it's been forever since we've been together, you and I have at last been reunited once again.

SISTER'S NOISE is something I long to find, so I will search the deepest depths of my mind,
(SORROW OF YOUR HEART...I SHOOT IT DOWN...)
and I swear that I'll always protect the smiles we shared from anyone who tried to threaten them.
Cause there's no one in the world who can defy their strength!
