Lyrics:
Release the dream you hold within your soul and let it flow
Beyond the reach of what the future has prepared.
The limits that we had have been surpassed, and fall away.
They sparkle with the light, freeing all my feelings inside.
I believe that they can be seen anywhere.

If I cannot advance, and must turn around, facing all the places I have been,
I wouldn’t have a choice, but to just destroy it all so I could start again.

How long can we stand, against the darkness above, as it falls upon the city and obstructs our view?
Surely we could stand, and save ourselves from the pain that runs all along this path and then carries through.

LOOK at THE blitzing LOOP of THIS PLANET TO SEARCH A WAY.
ONLY MY RAILGUN CAN SHOOT IT without delay.
Right now, the feeling here becomes so clear, and chases fear
Away from mind and heart, making shadows disappear.

Just seize the shining lights, the sparkling stars, all your desires
And leave nothing behind, take everything in reach.
I keep this oath in mind as I will find what’s left behind.
I’ll keep it close to heart, reaching out to any length to
Turn my falling tears into some inner strength.

Yet, I must now confess that I’m not immune to the pain I feel when I’m confused.
When I end up perplexed, I find that it's hard to hear a different point of view.

As I throw my coin into the air over me, I begin to focus on the things that stand in my way.
If I simply have a target that I can see, I'll know in my heart that it will all be okay.

SPARKLING! THE SHINY LIGHTS AWAKEN TRUE DESIRE!
ONLY MY RAILGUN CAN SHOOT IT, and as it fires,
it pierces without pause through obstacles, it targets flaws
That live inside of me, far beyond what most can see.

Aim clearly at the dream that I have seen, a shining sight
That tears apart the darkness here with bright Judgelight.
Just throw away the doubts that hold you down and hinder you.
My heart screams loudly here. I’ll make sure that my way stays clear.
I am not alone as long as this is true.

Uncounted wishes fall into my palms and tremble here.
This gathering of light shines bright within my hands.
The darkness that is torn reveals the thorn that digs into our darker memories
Hiding all that we could see.

I don’t want to give up, to just give in, lose to despair
That's left us with a colorless reality.
For now, I take my pride, this light inside, my inner guide
And put it on display, here for all the world to see!

LOOK at THE blitzing LOOP of THIS PLANET TO SEARCH A WAY.
ONLY MY RAILGUN CAN SHOOT IT without delay.
This feeling quickly grows, fills up my soul, and makes me whole.
It rises within me, charging myself completely.

Release the dream you hold within your soul, and let it flow
Beyond the reach of what the future has prepared.
The limits that we had have been surpassed and fall away.
They scatter forth as light; iridescent shards in the night.
I believe that they can be seen anywhere.
